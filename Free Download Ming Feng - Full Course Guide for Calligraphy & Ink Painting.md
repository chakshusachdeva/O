## Understanding the Legacy of Ming Feng

While "Ming Feng" might not be a universally recognized master in the same vein as Qi Baishi, the essence of the name embodies the spirit of traditional Chinese art. It translates roughly to "Bright Phoenix," symbolizing beauty, rebirth, and grace. Thinking of "Ming Feng" as a style, rather than a specific artist, helps us understand the artistic principles and techniques we aim to explore in this free downloadable course.

This course will focus on developing skills and techniques characteristic of artists inspired by the "Ming Feng" aesthetic: meticulous brushwork, elegant composition, and a deep appreciation for the symbolism inherent in traditional Chinese painting.
