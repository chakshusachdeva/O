## Who Was Mohammed Attar? Unveiling the Life of a Sufi Master

Farid ud-Din Attar, better known as Mohammed Attar, was a pivotal figure in the development of Sufi thought and literature. Born in Nishapur, Persia (modern-day Iran), around 1145, his life was marked by both worldly experience and deep spiritual seeking. Understanding his biography is crucial to appreciating the context of his works.

*   **Early Life and Profession:** Attar inherited his father's profession as a pharmacist (hence the name "Attar," meaning apothecary). This provided him with a unique perspective, allowing him to observe the human condition from a medical and compassionate standpoint. It is said he turned away from medicine after witnessing a beggar dying after being refused treatment.
*   **Spiritual Awakening:** The pivotal moment that ignited Attar's spiritual journey remains shrouded in legend. However, the story involves him abandoning his lucrative practice to dedicate himself to seeking spiritual enlightenment.
*   **Mystical Journey:** He embarked on a spiritual quest, travelling extensively and immersing himself in Sufi teachings. His journeys exposed him to diverse cultures and Sufi orders, further shaping his understanding of mystical principles.
*   **Martyrdom:** Attar's life tragically ended during the Mongol invasion of Nishapur in 1221. Legend holds that he was killed after refusing to sell his worth for a small price. This martyrdom further cemented his status as a Sufi saint.

## The Conference of the Birds: A Journey to Divine Understanding

Attar's most famous work, *Mantiq al-Tayr* (The Conference of the Birds), is a masterpiece of Sufi allegorical poetry. It recounts the epic journey of a flock of birds seeking their king, the Simorgh.

*   **The Allegory:** Each bird represents a different human flaw or attachment that hinders spiritual progress. The Hoopoe, as their guide, leads them on a perilous journey through seven valleys representing stages of spiritual development.
*   **The Seven Valleys:** These valleys (Quest, Love, Understanding, Detachment, Unity, Astonishment, and Annihilation) depict the challenging stages of the Sufi path, requiring dedication, sacrifice, and ultimately, the annihilation of the ego.
*   **The Simorgh:** The ultimate revelation is that the Simorgh is within themselves. The birds realize that by overcoming their individual limitations, they become one with the divine. This profound message underscores the Sufi concept of *fana* (annihilation) and *baqa* (subsistence in God).
*   **Themes:** The poem explores key Sufi themes such as the importance of a spiritual guide, the challenges of self-discipline, the nature of divine love, and the realization of unity with the divine.
