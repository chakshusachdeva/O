## The Power of Non-Verbal Communication

As highlighted in "My Com," **non-verbal communication** plays a significant role in how we communicate. Studies show that a large percentage of our communication is conveyed through non-verbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. Understanding and controlling your non-verbal communication can significantly enhance your ability to communicate effectively.

*   **Facial Expressions:** Pay attention to your facial expressions. Smile to show friendliness and engagement. Avoid frowning or scowling, which can convey negativity.
*   **Body Posture:** Maintain good posture. Stand or sit up straight to project confidence and authority.
*   **Eye Contact:** Make eye contact with the speaker to show that you're engaged and interested. Avoid staring or looking away, which can be interpreted as disinterest or disrespect.
*   **Gestures:** Use gestures to emphasize your points and add emphasis to your message. Avoid fidgeting or using distracting gestures.
*   **Tone of Voice:** Vary your tone of voice to add emotion and emphasis to your message. Avoid speaking in a monotone, which can be boring and unengaging.
