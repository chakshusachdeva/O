## The Power of BOGO: Stock Up and Save Big

Publix is famous for its Buy One Get One (BOGO) deals, which offer incredible savings on a wide variety of products. To make the most of these deals, keep the following tips in mind:

*   **Check the Expiration Dates:** Before stocking up on BOGO items, make sure to check the expiration dates to ensure that you can use them before they expire.
*   **Combine with Coupons:** In some cases, you can even combine BOGO deals with coupons for even greater savings. Check the fine print on the coupon to see if it is valid on BOGO items.
