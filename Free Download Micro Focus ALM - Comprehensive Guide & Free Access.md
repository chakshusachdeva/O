## What is Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)?

Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is the overarching process of managing an application from its initial conception to its retirement. It's more than just coding; it encompasses all aspects of software development, including:

*   **Requirements Gathering:** Understanding the needs and expectations of the users and stakeholders.
*   **Planning and Design:** Creating a roadmap for the development process, including architecture and design specifications.
*   **Development and Testing:** Writing the code and ensuring its quality through rigorous testing.
*   **Deployment and Maintenance:** Releasing the application to the users and providing ongoing support and updates.

ALM ensures that the software development process is aligned with business objectives, resulting in higher quality applications delivered on time and within budget. It's about collaboration, visibility, and traceability throughout the entire lifecycle.

## Why is ALM Important?

ALM is crucial for several reasons:

*   **Improved Quality:** By managing requirements, testing thoroughly, and tracking defects, ALM helps ensure higher quality software.
*   **Reduced Costs:** Early detection of issues and efficient management of resources can significantly reduce development costs.
*   **Faster Time to Market:** Streamlined processes and improved collaboration allow for quicker delivery of applications.
*   **Enhanced Collaboration:** ALM tools facilitate communication and collaboration among different teams involved in the development process.
*   **Better Compliance:** ALM provides a framework for adhering to regulatory requirements and industry best practices.
*   **Increased Visibility:** Stakeholders gain insights into the project's progress, risks, and overall health.
